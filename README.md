# Drawing-Web-Final
Final Project of DRAWING ON THE WEB @NYU SPRING 2018

## General Idea:
------------------

##### The project will feature three songs from different artists with different genres. However, it will have the same visual aesthetic that I want to explore with. In this whole semester, I learned multiple techniques about drawing on the web, yet my favorite are still the color-blend-mode and the pixel manipulation for the video processing on the web. So in my final project, I will play with these two techniques. Two songs out of three are from the artist: King Princess. Her music is really like indie-pop, so I want to use color blend mode to filter the detail beauty in our life (flower, traffic light, sunlight, etc.) I believe that these can be overlapped on each other to create the atmosphere for the song, and let the audience enjoy the beauty of it. Also, I will process the video that captures a simple moving object (like lips), and let it look different but still similar to the original video. Also, I will set the video delay for seconds in order to fit the songs.
